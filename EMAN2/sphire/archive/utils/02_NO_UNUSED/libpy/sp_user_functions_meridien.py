#  This file contains fuctions that perform project-dependent tasks in various
#   alignment programs, for example preparation of the reference during 2D and 3D alignment
#  To write you own function, modify the existing one (for example, wei_func is a version
#   of ref_ali2d) and add the name to the factory.  Once it is done, the function can be called
#   from appropriate application, in this case "sxali2d_c.py ...  --function=wei_func
